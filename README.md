## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) - It's a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) - For Series, DataFrame, and plots

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - For a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews and Bokeh that provides a general and consistent API for plotting data in all the abovementioned formats.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - For Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.


* [fpprophet](https://pypi.org/project/fbprophet/)- For forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install jupyterlab
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  pip install fbprophet
```


## Usage

To use the crytpo investment, simply clone the `crypto_invest' from the respository, open jupyter lab and open **crypto_investments.ipynb** with:

```python
jupyter lab
```

Re-run the jupyter book to produce learning prediction and charts.
